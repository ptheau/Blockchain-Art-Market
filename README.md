# Blockchain-for-the-art-market

This is a school project dedicated to blockchain. The objective of our group was to create a simple blockchain that could be used for the art market and that which would also incorporate an auction system. 

The main framework of the code comes from a tutorial on how to build a blockchain (https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46) and we made some modifications to adapt it to the art market. 

We believe that bringing blockchain to the art market could revolutionise it in different ways by:
- Facilitating the liquidity of the art market
- Fighting against counterfeits
- Developing the online art market
- Facilitating the loan of art pieces

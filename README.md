# Blockchain-for-the-art-market

This is a school project dedicated to blockchain. The objective of our group was to create a simple blockchain that could be used for the art market and that could also take into account auctions. 

The main framework of the code comes from a tutorial on how to build a blockchain () and we made some modifications to adapt it for the art market.
